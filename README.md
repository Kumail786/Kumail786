# 👋 Hey, I’m Kumail

I’m a developer and AI enthusiast passionate about building intelligent systems that create real-world impact.  
My work revolves around exploring the latest in artificial intelligence, automation, and machine learning, and turning those ideas into practical, usable tools.  

I believe in **learning in public** — sharing knowledge, experiments, and insights so that others can benefit from the journey.
